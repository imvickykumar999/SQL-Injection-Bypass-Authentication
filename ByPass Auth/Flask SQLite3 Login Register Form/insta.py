Instagram doesnâ€™t like bots because they distort the experience that users 
have on their platforms. While bots can be used for good purposes, 
such as providing customer support or delivering news updates, 
they can also be employed for nefarious reasons, like spreading 
misinformation or deliberately flooding a conversation with spam comments.
